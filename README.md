# NoteTaker
 
This is a Complete Java Web Project using Hibernate, JSP and Servlets.

This is a good project for understanding basics of Advanced Java.

I have used CRUD operations to Add, Read, Update and Delete the notes. I have created Servlets for each operation.

The Server I have used is TomCat v9. 
I have also used Maven.
For CSS I have used Bootstrap 4.
